# Security-Audit-Botium-Toys

This repository showcases my work on a security audit project for Botium Toys, a fictional toy company. As part of my learning in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program, I conducted an internal audit to identify vulnerabilities, check for compliance gaps, and suggest ways to improve their security.
